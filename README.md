# Suricata IDS Lab (Coursera Sandbox)

This repository contains a hands-on lab completed in the Coursera Cybersecurity course, focusing on **Intrusion Detection using Suricata**.

## Overview
- Configured and tested **custom IDS rules** using Suricata.
- Monitored **simulated network traffic** from PCAP files.
- Examined and analyzed alert logs (`fast.log` and `eve.json`) to understand flow IDs, protocols, and signature-based alerts.

## Tools Used
- Suricata IDS
- Bash Shell / Linux Terminal
- `jq` for JSON parsing
- Sample PCAP files

## Tasks Completed
1. Examined and understood the structure of Suricata rules.
2. Created custom rules to detect specific HTTP traffic.
3. Triggered alerts using sample network traffic.
4. Analyzed logs in `fast.log` and `eve.json` to interpret alerts.
5. Extracted and visualized key fields from JSON logs for analysis.



## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic monitoring and analysis
- IDS rule writing and testing
- JSON log parsing and alert evaluation
- Basic cybersecurity threat detection workflow
